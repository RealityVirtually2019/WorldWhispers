# Connection
## Summary
The Connection folder contains all of the assets (scripts, art, prefabs, etc.) used for the WearableConnectUIPanel and WearableDeviceDisplay prefabs. These two prefabs help to encapsulate typical Bose AR device operations for searching, connection, and reconnection in an easy-to-use fashion. It can also be easily customized.

**NOTE:** There is an atlas in the `Connection/Atlas` folder that has all of the art assets used for the prefabs. If customization or use of just the scripts is desired, you may want to modify or delete this. See [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SpriteAtlas.html) for more information on Unity Sprite Atlases and Sprite Packing.

## Getting Started
To quickly add the ability to connect to a Bose AR device, drop the `Bose/Wearable/Connection/Prefabs/WearableConnectUIPanel` Prefab into the scene you would like to the device connection screen to first appear.

## Removing this content
The content in the Examples folder depends on assets within this folder, but the rest of the plugin does not; the Examples and Connection folder can be deleted without removing the core plugin functionality.
